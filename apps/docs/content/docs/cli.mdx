The Sitesearch CLI scaffolds experiences, syncs Algolia config, and keeps your components up to date. Think of it as the glue between your repo and our templates.

## Installation

- Run once with `pnpm dlx` (recommended for quick experiments)
- Or install locally if you prefer a pinned version

```bash
pnpm add -D @sitesearch/cli
```

> We tag releases frequently. Consider using `@latest` when invoking `pnpm dlx`.

## Common commands

- `sitesearch init` — scaffold an experience in your Next.js app
- `sitesearch upgrade` — pull the latest component changes into your local copies
- `sitesearch sync analytics` — ensure Insights events align with your Algolia app configuration
- `sitesearch doctor` — run diagnostics for missing env vars, outdated packages, or schema mismatches

```bash
pnpm dlx @sitesearch/cli@latest init \
  --preset search-askai \
  --path apps/web/app/(search)/page.tsx \
  --use-demo-data
```

## Workflow tips

- Re-run `init` with a new preset in a scratch folder to compare layouts before committing.
- Use `upgrade --dry-run` to preview diffs and cherry-pick only the pieces you need.
- Add `doctor` to your CI so missing tokens or credentials fail fast.
