description: "Our philosophy is simple: copy search experiences as components, customize freely. No complex configuration, just grab what you need and make it yours."

Sitesearch gives you a curated catalog of Algolia-powered search experiences. Copy the pieces you need, wire them to your data, and keep moving—no yak-shaving on autocomplete state machines or analytics plumbing.

Like shadcn/ui, everything lives in your repo. You can read the source, fork it, and ship variants that match your product’s tone of voice.

## Why we built this

- **Move faster:** Borrow production-ready search patterns instead of prototyping from scratch.
- **Stay flexible:** Every component ships uncompiled. Change the layout, switch styling systems, or replace logic as your product evolves.
- **First-class Algolia:** We bake in search, insights, and AI answer patterns using Algolia best practices.

## How to use the docs

- Start with the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) to scaffold your first page.
- Browse **Experiences** to see finished flows like `Search` and `Search + AskAI`.
- Take experiences and components as building blocks to compose your own layouts.
- Check **Foundations** (Theming, Data sources, Extensibility) for deeper guidance.
