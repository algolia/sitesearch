description: "Our philosophy is simple: copy Algolia search experiences as components, customize freely. No complex configuration, just grab what you need and make it yours."

Sitesearch helps you ship Algolia-powered search interfaces without rebuilding the basics. Start from an opinionated experience, then tailor the styling, layout, and data hooks to your product.

This quickstart mirrors the shadcn/ui flow: install the CLI, scaffold a page, and iterate locally before publishing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- A package manager (`pnpm`, `yarn`, or `npm`)
- An Algolia application with an index you can read from (Analytics optional but recommended)
- Basic familiarity with Next.js and React Server Components

> Tip: If you are evaluating, you can point the starter at the demo Algolia dataset shipped with the CLI and switch to your own credentials later.

## 1. Install the Sitesearch CLI

We recommend running the CLI with `pnpm dlx`, but you can also add it to your devDependencies.

```bash
pnpm dlx @sitesearch/cli@latest init
```

You will be asked to choose an experience preset (`Search`, `Search + AskAI`, `AskAI Sidepanel`) and whether to wire in demo data.

## 2. Configure Algolia credentials

After the CLI finishes scaffolding, update `sitesearch.config.ts` at the root of your app.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  appId: process.env.ALGOLIA_APP_ID!,
  apiKey: process.env.ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY!,
  indexName: "products",
});
```

Store your credentials in `.env.local` and restart the dev server so the config is picked up.

## 3. Run the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Navigate to `/search` (or the route the CLI created) to explore. The starter ships with sensible defaults: keyboard navigation, empty state messaging, and analytics events wired through Algolia Insights.

## 4. Customize the experience

- **Styling:** tweak tokens in `sitesearch/theme.ts` or swap to your design system tokens. Components expose `className` overrides for fine-grained control.
- **Data:** adjust the InstantSearch widgets inside the generated `page.tsx`. You can add federated sources, derived attributes, or switch ranking formulas without leaving the template.
- **UX additions:** drop in call-to-actions, onboarding modals, or telemetry hooks. Each experience exposes headless primitives so you can recompose the layout when needed.

## 5. Ship it

When you are ready, run:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred platform. Because everything is just React + Algolia, you can progressively enhance existing pages instead of migrating your whole app.
